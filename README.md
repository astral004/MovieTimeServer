# Mern Project part 2

### Tasks achieved:
> Added backend functionality to start the app, expose the server, and set up its routes. Those routes will handle 
> requests and send them to the correct controller methods. The controller methods will invoke the respective DAO 
> methods.  
> Added testing for all backend functionality.
